## Experiments
This directory contains all the supplementary material used for creating the experiments during our project. These experiments were later used to (1) create plots and evaluations in the report, or (2) gain insights in model performance.

## Structure of Directory
- `/configs`: This folder contains the different configurations of reinforcements. Using these configurations, we have observed the performance difference depending on the combination of reinforcements used.
- `/notebooks`: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used in experimentation, such as hyperparamater tuning for the simple baselines.
