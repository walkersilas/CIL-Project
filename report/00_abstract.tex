With the rise in popularity of personalized content, smart recommendations are becoming ever more important to get right; they can drive or slash user interaction. One of the most attractive methods to generate predictive compatibility scores for never-before-seen content is collaborative filtering. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative filtering model based on a graph neural network extended with reinforcements and show that this RGNN model can generate user ratings with state-of-the-art accuracy.\footnote{Source code is available at \url{https://github.com/walkersilas/CIL-Project}.}
