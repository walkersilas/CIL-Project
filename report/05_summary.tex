In this paper, we develop a graph neural network architecture with added reinforcements from simple matrix factorization techniques for collaborative filtering. This method improves upon several baseline approaches by a significant margin on the public Kaggle dataset (\autoref{tab:results}). 
Following our ablation study comparing the NCF, GNN, and GNN + NCF baselines, we find that model performance depends on both generating meaningful embeddings of users and items and the expressiveness of the neural network used.
We further show that reinforcements generated by the SlopeOne algorithm \citep{lemire2005slope} yields the best results.

In future work, we would like to further explore different types of reinforcements, particularly outputs from more complex models such as neural networks. Similarly, recursive reinforcements can be explored. Extending our experiments to include datasets with a lower sparsity level such as MovieLens can also further investigate the generalizability of our proposed RGNN architecture.
